Like Hell You Are
By Isabel Duarte Gray

The Devil made a meal of me and all
the Sundays I was sleeping.
To think of all the hours,
what I might've offered to the Book or of the Book
to needful ears grown up like burdock in our hag-rid
thorn-bit flock of town.

Sunday at the bedpost, heeling way
a good dog might, his face near a man's.
He kept a blade to pick his teeth, what fathers used
for supper fixed the way our mothers did,
hog meat from a creature slaughtered on the land.

Now I don't fix any man a meal like her,
and work it is to do it, though only one child mine to hush.
Her supper was a parting, like
to square it up with him and God,
what order seemed most right to her.
Did she even love them?

What I fixed was skin, thumbed good,
unbound, leafed through, like these
trees would free me something fresh, and
something came and gone without a word.
